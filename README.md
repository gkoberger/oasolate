### OASolate

Isolate a single endpoint from an OpenAPI Spec file, for easier debugging!

Currently, it's pretty simplistic. It just removes all paths and components not used. It's possible it'll break a few OAS files or cause unintented errors!

Future support, maybe:

  - [ ] Remove unused auth schemas, etc
  - [ ] Remove unused servers, etc
